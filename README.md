This repo has a Sudoku Solver smartphone app as the final goal. 
This app should be capable of:
1. Use the camera to scan a sudoku setup, possibly distinguish machine-typed and handwritten entries
2. Tries to find a solution with the given information
If hand-written digit recognition is functional:
3. If no solution is found, then a solution from scratch is attempted
4. Depending on user settings, shows whole solution, or wrong entries.
